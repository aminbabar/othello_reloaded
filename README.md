## Background
This project is going to focus on creating a working version of Othello. Once completed,
different computer players will be implemented using some of the popular
algorithms in Artificial Intelligence.
 
 
 
## Functionality and MVPs
Users in this game will be able to:
* Start and reset the game board
* Select squares that are live and be able to make their move on that square
* Choose from a list of computer players, each of which would rely on a different algorithm
 
 
 
This project will also include:
* A production README
* A tutorial for how to play the game and how different algorithms work
 
 
 
## Wireframes

Options will contains a list of all the AI players available for the user to play against
 
 
## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
* Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
* npm to manage project dependencies
 
 
 
## Implementation Timeline
* __Friday:__
Start with the project. Finish with the implementation for the
game logic of othello
* __Weekend:__
Look into minimax algorithm, alpha beta pruning and monte carlo
* __Monday:__ 
Finish off with the implementation of computer players with research on
different heuristics.
* __Tuesday:__
Implement the front end. Have the board and controls be displayed nicely to the user.
Also, add animation to the flipping of board pieces
* __Wednesday:__
Look into the visualization for tree structure for different computer players
* __Thursday:__
Deploy the website online, possibly on heroku
 
 
## Bonus Features
* Visualization of the tree data structure for each algorithm
* Pit the computer players against each other and visualize that data to better judge
different AI algorithms.
* Give the human player the option of possibly defeating the show off computer player
by throwing a fireball at the computer player and distracting it!
